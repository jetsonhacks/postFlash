# postFlash
Post flash setup for NVIDIA Jetson TK1 Development Kit. After flashing the Jetson with L4T 21.X, there are a couple of extra settings that can changed for better performance when using the Jetson as a desktop. In order to retrieve this repository, you will need to have 'git' installed. You can install 'git' by executing from a Terminal:

$ sudo apt-get install git

To configure the system, clone this repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/jetsonhacks/postFlash.git

This is for the current release, L4T 21.5

For earlier releases, clone this repository with the appropriate 'Tag'. For example,

$ git clone -b JetsonTK1-L4T-21.2 https://github.com/jetsonhacks/postFlash.git

will get the appropriate code for the L4T-21.2 release. Scripts are currently available for L4T-21.2 and L4T-21.3.

Once downloaded, open a Terminal, switch to the repository directory, and execute the configureSystem script, i.e.

$ cd postFlash

$ ./configureSystem.sh

Install notes:

Because Firefox on the Jetson has issues downloading zip files on the Jetson, the Chromium browser is installed.

To save power, the Jetson will autosuspend the USB ports. In a desktop environment, this may cause problems with various USB devices such as webcams. USB autosuspend is disabled in the /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf used by the uboot bootloader..

As a mobile device, the Jetson is configured to save power by promoting lower clock speeds and turning off CPU cores. As a desktop machine, this is not as much of a concern, so a startup script to maximize CPU and GPU performance is installed. There is some extra power draw after this procedure (~0.5W).

USB 3.0 is disabled in the stock setup, this script enables USB 3.0.

Startup scripts are stored in /usr/local/bin
